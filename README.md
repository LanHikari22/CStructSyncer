# CStructSyncer
This is a compilation of programs that can pad and sort C structs. 
They can also generate docs that can then be sync'd with their associated structs

# input
* A C structure typedef template. It is recompiled in a sense, and filled with the necessary pads so that it is functional.
* A document can also be generated and syncronized and merged with structs.
